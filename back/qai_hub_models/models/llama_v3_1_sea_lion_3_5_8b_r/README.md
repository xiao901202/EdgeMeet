# [Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R: Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R is a hybrid model offering versatile functionality, handling both complex reasoning tasks and general text generation, with mode selection managed through the tokenizer's chat template](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r)

SEA-LION is a collection of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have been pretrained and instruct-tuned for the Southeast Asia (SEA) region. The model is quantized to w4a16 (4-bit weights and 16-bit activations) and part of the model is quantized to w8a16 (8-bit weights and 16-bit activations) making it suitable for on-device deployment. For Prompt and output length specified below, the time to first token is Llama-PromptProcessor-Quantized's latency and average time per addition token is Llama-TokenGenerator-Quantized's latency.

This is based on the implementation of Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R found [here](https://github.com/aisingapore/sealion/blob/main/models/sea-lion-v3.5/llama-sea-lion-v3.5-8B.md). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r).
