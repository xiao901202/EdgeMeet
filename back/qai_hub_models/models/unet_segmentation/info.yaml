description: UNet is a machine learning model that produces a segmentation mask for an image. The most basic use case will label each pixel in the image as being in the foreground or the background. More advanced usage will assign a class label to each pixel. This version of the model was trained on the data from Kaggle's Carvana Image Masking Challenge (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) and is used for vehicle segmentation.
