# [Llama-v3.1-8B-Instruct: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_8b_instruct)

Llama 3 is a family of LLMs. The model is quantized to w4a16 (4-bit weights and 16-bit activations) and part of the model is quantized to w8a16 (8-bit weights and 16-bit activations) making it suitable for on-device deployment. For Prompt and output length specified below, the time to first token is Llama-PromptProcessor-Quantized's latency and average time per addition token is Llama-TokenGenerator-Quantized's latency.

This is based on the implementation of Llama-v3.1-8B-Instruct found [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/tree/main). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_8b_instruct).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Deploying Llama 3.1 on-device

Please follow the [LLM on-device deployment](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial.



## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai-hub-models[llama-v3-1-8b-instruct]" torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 aimet-onnx==2.6.0
```

Install the GPU package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai-hub-models[llama-v3-1-8b-instruct]" torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases/download/2.6.0/aimet_onnx-2.6.0+cu121-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```



Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.llama_v3_1_8b_instruct.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This repository contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.llama_v3_1_8b_instruct.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
