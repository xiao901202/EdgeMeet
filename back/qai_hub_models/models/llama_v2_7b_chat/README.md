# [Llama-v2-7B-Chat: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v2_7b_chat)

Llama 2 is a family of LLMs. The "Chat" at the end indicates that the model is optimized for chatbot-like dialogue. The model is quantized to w4a16(4-bit weights and 16-bit activations) and part of the model is quantized to w8a16(8-bit weights and 16-bit activations) making it suitable for on-device deployment. For Prompt and output length specified below, the time to first token is Llama-PromptProcessor-Quantized's latency and average time per addition token is Llama-TokenGenerator-KVCache-Quantized's latency.

This is based on the implementation of Llama-v2-7B-Chat found [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v2_7b_chat).

## Deploying Llama 2 on-device

Please follow the [LLM on-device deployment](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial.

## Sample output prompts generated on-device
1. --prompt "what is gravity?" --max-output-tokens 30
~~~
-------- Response Summary --------
Prompt: what is gravity?
Response: Hello! I'm here to help you answer your question. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that affects the behavior of objects with mass
~~~

2. --prompt "what is 2+3?" --max-output-tokens 30
~~~
-------- Response Summary --------
Prompt: what is 2+3?
Response: Of course! I'm happy to help! The answer to 2+3 is 5.
~~~

3. --prompt "could you please write code for fibonacci series in python?" --max-output-tokens 100
~~~
-------- Response Summary --------
Prompt: could you please write code for fibonacci series in python?
Response: Of course! Here is an example of how you could implement the Fibonacci sequence in Python:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
You can test the function by calling it with different values of `n`, like this:
```
print(fibonacci(5))
