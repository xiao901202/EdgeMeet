description: BiSeNet (Bilateral Segmentation Network) is a novel architecture designed for real-time semantic segmentation. It addresses the challenge of balancing spatial resolution and receptive field by employing a Spatial Path to preserve high-resolution features and a context path to capture sufficient receptive field.
