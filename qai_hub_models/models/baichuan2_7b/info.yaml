headline: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks.
domain: Generative AI
description: Baichuan2-7B is a family of LLMs. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance of its size on standard Chinese and English authoritative benchmarks (C-EVAL/MMLU). 4-bit weights and 16-bit activations making it suitable for on-device deployment. For Prompt and output length specified below, the time to first token is Baichuan2-PromptProcessor-Quantized's latency and average time per addition token is Baichuan2-TokenGenerator-Quantized's latency.

technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: '128'
  Context length: '4096'
  Number of parameters: 7.07B
  Precision: w4a16 + w8a16 (few layers)
  Num of key-value heads: '8'
  Information about the model parts: Prompt Processor and Token Generator are split into 5 parts each. Each corresponding Prompt Processor and Token Generator part share weights.
  Prompt processor model size: 5.06 GB
  Prompt processor input (part1): 128 tokens
  Prompt processor output (part1): Embeddings output
  Prompt processor input (other parts): 128 tokens + KVCache initialized with pad token
  Prompt processor output (other parts): 128 output tokens + KVCache for token generator
  Token generator model size: 5.06 GB
  Token generator input (part1): 128 tokens
  Token generator output (part1): Embeddings output
  Token generator input (other parts): 1 input token + past KVCache
  Token generator output (other parts): 1 output token + KVCache for next iteration
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Supported languages: Chinese and English.
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.27.7
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
