headline: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks.
domain: Generative AI
description: PLaMo-1B is the first small language model (SLM) in the PLaMo™ Lite series from Preferred Networks (PFN), designed to power AI applications for edge devices including mobile, automotive, and robots across various industrial sectors. This model builds on the advancements of PLaMo-100B, a 100-billion parameter large language model (LLM) developed from the ground up by PFN’s subsidiary Preferred Elements (PFE). Leveraging high-quality Japanese and English text data generated by PLaMo-100B, PLaMo-1B has been pre-trained on a total of 4 trillion tokens. As a result, it delivers exceptional performance in Japanese benchmarks, outperforming other SLMs with similar parameter sizes. In evaluations such as Jaster 0-shot and 4-shot, PLaMo-1B has demonstrated performance on par with larger LLMs, making it a highly efficient solution for edge-based AI tasks.

technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: '128'
  Context length: '4096'
  Number of parameters: 1B
  Precision: w4a16 + w8a16 (few layers)
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.27.7
  Supported languages: Japanese and English.
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
