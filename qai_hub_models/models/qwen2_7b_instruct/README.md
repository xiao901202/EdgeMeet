# [Qwen2-7B-Instruct: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_7b_instruct)

The Qwen2-7B-Instruct is a state-of-the-art multilingual language model with 7.07 billion parameters, excelling in language understanding, generation, coding, and mathematics. AI Hub provides with four QNN context binaries (shared weights) that can be deployed on Snapdragon 8 Elite with Genie SDK.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen2-7B-Instruct found [here](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_7b_instruct).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.
