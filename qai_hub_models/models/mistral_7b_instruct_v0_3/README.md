# [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/mistral_7b_instruct_v0_3)

Mistral AI's first open source dense model released September 2023. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 Large Language Model (LLM) is an instruct fine‑tuned version of the Mistral‑7B‑v0.3. It has an extended vocabulary and supports the v3 Tokenizer, enhancing language understanding and generation. Additionally function calling is enabled.

This is based on the implementation of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 found [here](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/mistral_7b_instruct_v0_3).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.
