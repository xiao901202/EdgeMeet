# [IBM-Granite-v3.1-8B-Instruct: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of code understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ibm_granite_v3_1_8b_instruct)

Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct is a 8B parameter long-context instruct model finetuned from Granite-3.1-8B-Base using a combination of open source instruction datasets with permissive license and internally collected synthetic datasets tailored for solving long context problems. This model is developed using a diverse set of techniques with a structured chat format, including supervised finetuning, model alignment using reinforcement learning, and model merging.

This is based on the implementation of IBM-Granite-v3.1-8B-Instruct found [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.1-8b-instruct). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/ibm_granite_v3_1_8b_instruct).
