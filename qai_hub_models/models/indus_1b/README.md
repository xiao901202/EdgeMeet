# [IndusQ-1.1B: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/indus_1b)

Indus is today a 1.2 billion parameter model and has been supervised fine tuned for Hindi and dialects.

This is based on the implementation of IndusQ-1.1B found [here](https://huggingface.co/nickmalhotra/ProjectIndus). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/indus_1b).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Deploying IndusQ-1.1B on-device

Please follow the [LLM on-device deployment](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial.
