headline: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks.
domain: Generative AI
description: Phi-3.5-mini is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open model built upon datasets used for Phi-3 - synthetic data and filtered publicly available websites - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family and supports 128K token context length. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.

  Information about the model parts: Prompt Processor and Token Generator are split into 4 parts each. Each corresponding Prompt Processor and Token Generator part share weights.
  Prompt processor model size: 2.16 GB
  Token generator model size: 2.16 GB
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Supported languages: English, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Ukranian
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.28.2
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
